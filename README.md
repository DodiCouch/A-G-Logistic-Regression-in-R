# A-G-Logistic-Regression-in-R
R project for class 

Geologists have long known that the presence of antimony in a ground sample can be a good indication that there is a gold deposit nearby. 
In the attached data, you will find antimony (Sb) levels for 64 different locations, and whether or not gold was found nearby. 
The "gold" column is coded as 0 for no gold present, and 1 for gold present.

Use logistic regression in R to create a prediction model that will give the probability of the presence of gold as a response. 
Your complete report should contain the following information:
  
1. Testing and correction for assumptions if necessary. 
2. Give interpretation of the results in layman's terms.
